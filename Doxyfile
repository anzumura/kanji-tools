### ALIASES (custom commands)

# one '\XX_group' '\end_group' pair should be put inside the top level namespace 
# in each header in order to include all classes, global functions and variables
ALIASES += end_group="@}" doc="\copydoc"

# 'hdr' is used by below 'single arg' aliases. It adds 'lib' as well as expected
# prefix to '#include' section on the 'class' page. This 'command' should come
# after 'brief' description so that IDEs work properly when showing doc hints.
ALIASES += hdr{2}=" [lib: \b \1]\headerfile \2.h kanji_tools/\1/\2.h"

# single arg 'XX_group' and 'XX' aliases for each lib (XX) in the project
